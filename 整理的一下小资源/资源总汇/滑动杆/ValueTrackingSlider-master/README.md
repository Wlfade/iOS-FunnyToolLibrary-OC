ValueTrackingSlider
========

What is it?
---

A UISlider Subclass that displays live values in a popUpView. It’s inspired by the implementation found [here](https://github.com/mneuwert/iOS-Custom-Controls). This version is built using CALayers, it offers a few more features and it's easy to customize the appearance.

Features
---

* Live updating of UISlider value
* Customizable properties:
  * textColor
  * font
  * popUpViewColor
  * popUpViewAnimatedColors - popUpView and UISlider track color animate as value changes
* Set your own NSNumberFormatter to control the displayed values
* Wholesome springy animation


Which files are needed?
---

For [CocoaPods](http://beta.cocoapods.org) users, simply add `pod 'ASValueTrackingSlider'` to your podfile. If you'd like to test the included demo project before including it in your own work, then type `$ pod try ASValueTrackingSlider` in your terminal. CocoaPods will download the demo project into a temp folder and open it in Xcode. Magic.

If you don't use CocoaPods, just include these files in your project:

* ASValueTrackingSlider (.h .m)
* ASValuePopUpView (.h .m)


How to use it
---

It’s very simple. Drag a UISlider into your Storyboard/nib and set its class to ASValueTrackingSlider – that's it.
The examples below demonstrate how to customize the appearance and value displayed.

```objective-c
self.slider.maximumValue = 255.0;
[self.slider setMaxFractionDigitsDisplayed:0];
self.slider.popUpViewColor = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.55 saturation:0.8 brightness:0.9 alpha:0.7];
self.slider.font = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Menlo-Bold" size:22];
self.slider.textColor = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.55 saturation:1.0 brightness:0.5 alpha:1];
```

```objective-c
NSNumberFormatter *formatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
[formatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterPercentStyle];
[self.slider setNumberFormatter:formatter];
self.slider.popUpViewAnimatedColors = @[[UIColor purpleColor], [UIColor redColor], [UIColor orangeColor]];
self.slider.font = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Futura-CondensedExtraBold" size:26];
```

The popUpView adjusts itself so that it doesn't extend beyond the width of the slider control.
